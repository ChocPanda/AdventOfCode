# AdventOfCode 2018 #

Welcome to my attempt at [AdventOfCode 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/)!

Thanks very much [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) for putting the calendar together

It's my first year taking part so I'm not really playing competitively,
instead I'm just having some fun and using this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge
